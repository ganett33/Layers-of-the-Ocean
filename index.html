                      Seahorses range in size from 1.5 to 35.5 cm (5⁄8 to 14
                      in). They are named for their equine appearance, with bent
                      necks and long snouted heads and a distinctive trunk and
                      tail. Although they are bony fish, they do not have
                      scales, but rather thin skin stretched over a series of
                      bony plates, which are arranged in rings throughout their
                      bodies. Each species has a distinct number of rings. The
                      armor of bony plates also protects them against predators,
                      and because of this outer skeleton, they no longer have
                      ribs. Seahorses swim upright, propelling themselves using
                      the dorsal fin, another characteristic not shared by their
                      close pipefish relatives, which swim horizontally.
                      Razorfish are the only other fish that swim vertically.
                      The pectoral fins, located on either side of the head
                      behind their eyes, are used for steering. They lack the
                      caudal fin typical of fishes. Their prehensile tail is
                      composed of square-like rings that can be unlocked only in
                      the most extreme conditions. They are adept at camouflage,
                      and can grow and reabsorb spiny appendages depending on
                      their habitat.

                      In general, sea turtles have a more fusiform body plan
                      than their terrestrial or freshwater counterparts. This
                      tapering at both ends reduces volume and means that sea
                      turtles cannot retract their head and limbs into their
                      shells for protection, unlike many other turtles and
                      tortoises. However, the streamlined body plan reduces
                      friction and drag in the water and allows sea turtles to
                      swim more easily and swiftly. <br />The leatherback sea
                      turtle is the largest sea turtle, measuring 2–3 m (6–9 ft)
                      in length, 1–1.5 m (3–5 ft) in width, and weighing up to
                      700 kg (1500 lb). Other sea turtle species are smaller,
                      being mostly 60–120 cm (2–4 ft) long and proportionally
                      narrower. The skulls of sea turtles have cheek regions
                      that are enclosed in bone. Although this condition appears
                      to resemble that found in the earliest known fossil
                      reptiles (anapsids), it is possible it is a more recently
                      evolved trait in sea turtles, placing them outside the
                      anapsids.

                    <p class="card-content">
                      A dolphin is an aquatic mammal within the infraorder
                      Cetacea. Dolphin species belong to the families
                      Delphinidae (the oceanic dolphins), Platanistidae (the
                      Indian river dolphins), Iniidae (the New World river
                      dolphins), Pontoporiidae (the brackish dolphins), and the
                      extinct Lipotidae (baiji or Chinese river dolphin). There
                      are 40 extant species named as dolphins. Dolphins range in
                      size from the 1.7-metre-long (5 ft 7 in) and 50-kilogram
                      (110-pound) Maui's dolphin to the 9.5 m (31 ft 2 in) and
                      10-tonne (11-short-ton) orca. Various species of dolphins
                      exhibit sexual dimorphism where the males are larger than
                      females. <br />They have streamlined bodies and two limbs
                      that are modified into flippers. Though not quite as
                      flexible as seals, some dolphins can briefly travel at
                      speeds of 29 kilometres (18 mi) per hour or leap about 30
                      feet (9.1 m). Dolphins use their conical teeth to capture
                      fast-moving prey. They have well-developed hearing which
                      is adapted for both air and water. It is so well developed
                      that some can survive even if they are blind. Some species
                      are well adapted for diving to great depths. They have a
                      layer of fat, or blubber, under the skin to keep warm in
                      the cold water.

                      The blue whale is a slender-bodied cetacean with a broad
                      U-shaped head; thin, elongated flippers; a small 33
                      centimeters (13 in) sickle-shaped dorsal fin located close
                      to the tail and a large tail stock at the root of the wide
                      and thin flukes. The upper jaw is lined with 70–395 black
                      baleen plates. The throat region has 60–88 grooves which
                      allows the skin to expand during feeding. It has two
                      blowholes that can squirt 9.1–12.2 meters (30–40 ft) up in
                      the air. <br />The skin has a mottled grayish-blue
                      coloration, appearing blue underwater. The mottling
                      patterns near the dorsal fin vary between individuals. The
                      underbelly has lighter pigmentation and can appear
                      yellowish due to diatoms in the water, which historically
                      earned them the nickname "sulphur bottom". The male blue
                      whale has the largest penis in the animal kingdom, at
                      around 3 m (9.8 ft) long and 12 in (30 cm) wide.

                      An octopus (pl: octopuses,octopi, or octopodes, see below
                      for variants) is a soft-bodied, eight-limbed mollusc of
                      the order Octopoda (/ɒkˈtɒpədə/, ok-TOP-ə-də[3]). The
                      order consists of some 300 species and is grouped within
                      the class Cephalopoda with squids, cuttlefish, and
                      nautiloids. Like other cephalopods, an octopus is
                      bilaterally symmetric with two eyes and a beaked mouth at
                      the center point of the eight limbs. The soft body can
                      radically alter its shape, enabling octopuses to squeeze
                      through small gaps. They trail their eight appendages
                      behind them as they swim. The siphon is used both for
                      respiration and for locomotion, by expelling a jet of
                      water. <br />Octopuses have a complex nervous system and
                      excellent sight, and are among the most intelligent and
                      behaviourally diverse of all invertebrates.

                      They commonly reach 3 m (10 ft) in length, and the maximum
                      reported is 4.55 m (14 ft 11 in) in length and 650 kg
                      (1,430 lb) in weight. The International Game Fish
                      Association's all-tackle angling record for a swordfish
                      was a 536 kg (1,182 lb) specimen taken off Chile in 1953.
                      Females are larger than males, and Pacific swordfish reach
                      a greater size than northwest Atlantic and Mediterranean
                      swordfish. <br />They reach maturity at 4–5 years of age
                      and the maximum age is believed to be at least 9 years.
                      The oldest swordfish found in a recent study were a
                      16-year-old female and 12-year-old male. Swordfish ages
                      are derived, with difficulty, from annual rings on fin
                      rays rather than otoliths, since their otoliths are small

                      A. ocellatus differs from true eels, as they have paired
                      gill slits and pectoral fins. The animal can grow up to
                      2.4 m (7 ft 10 in) in length and 18.4 kg (41 lb) in
                      weight. Younger wolf eels are orange with big dark spots
                      in the posterior part of the body. Once older they turn
                      grey, brown greyish or dark olive. They possess powerful
                      jaws with which they crush their prey: canine teeth in the
                      front and molars in the posterior portion of the mouth. In
                      the anal fin, it has no rays and 233 radials. It only has
                      one dorsal fin, that extends from the head to the end of
                      the body, with 228 to 250 flexible fishbones without soft
                      radius. <br />The caudal fin is small. It has no pelvic
                      fins, nor a lateral line. Males have large lips and a
                      protuberance on the superior part of the head. The
                      lifespan of this species is about 20 years.

                      Psychrolutes marcidus, the smooth-head blobfish, also
                      known simply as blobfish, is a deep-sea fish of the family
                      Psychrolutidae. It inhabits the deep waters off the coasts
                      of mainland Australia and Tasmania, as well as the waters
                      of New Zealand. <br />Blobfish are typically shorter than
                      30 cm (12 in). They live at depths between 600 and 1,200 m
                      (2,000 and 3,900 ft), where the pressure is 60 to 120
                      times greater than that at sea level, which would likely
                      make gas bladders inefficient for maintaining buoyancy.
                      Instead, the flesh of the blobfish is primarily a
                      gelatinous mass with a density slightly less than that of
                      water; this allows the fish to float above the sea floor
                      without expending energy on swimming. The blobfish has a
                      relative lack of muscle, but this is not a disadvantage,
                      as its main food source is edible matter that floats in
                      front of it, such as deep-ocean crustaceans.

                      A viperfish is any species of marine fish in the genus
                      Chauliodus. Viperfishes are mostly found in the
                      mesopelagic zone and are characterized by long,
                      needle-like teeth and hinged lower jaws. A typical
                      viperfish grows to lengths of 30 cm (12 in). Viperfishes
                      undergo diel vertical migration and are found all around
                      the world in tropical and temperate oceans.<br />
                      Viperfishes possess photophores along the ventral side of
                      their body, likely used to camouflage them by blending in
                      with the less than 1% of light that reaches to below 200
                      meters depth. Although it may appear to be covered in
                      scales, viperfishes do not possess scales. Rather, they
                      are covered by a thick, transparent coating of unknown
                      substance. Extremely large, fang-like teeth give the fish
                      a slightly protruded lower jaw.

                      The anglerfish are fish of the teleost order Lophiiformes
                      (/ˌlɒfiɪˈfɔːrmiːz/). They are bony fish named for their
                      characteristic mode of predation, in which a modified
                      luminescent fin ray (the esca or illicium) acts as a lure
                      for other fish. <br />The luminescence comes from
                      symbiotic bacteria, which are thought to be acquired from
                      seawater, that dwell in and around the sea. Some
                      anglerfish are notable for extreme sexual dimorphism and
                      sexual symbiosis of the small male with the much larger

                      Shrimp are crustaceans (a form of shellfish) with
                      elongated bodies and a primarily swimming mode of
                      locomotion – most commonly Caridea and Dendrobranchiata of
                      the decapod order, although some crustaceans outside of
                      this order are referred to as "shrimp". <br />More narrow
                      definitions may be restricted to Caridea, to smaller
                      species of either group or to only the marine species.
                      Under a broader definition, shrimp may be synonymous with
                      prawn, covering stalk-eyed swimming crustaceans with long,
                      narrow muscular tails (abdomens), long whiskers
                      (antennae), and slender legs. <br />Any small crustacean
                      which resembles a shrimp tends to be called one. They swim
                      forward by paddling with swimmerets on the underside of
                      their abdomens, although their escape response is
                      typically repeated flicks with the tail driving them
                      backwards very quickly. Crabs and lobsters have strong
                      walking legs, whereas shrimp have thin, fragile legs which
                      they use primarily for perching.

                      Siboglinidae is a family of polychaete annelid worms whose
                      members made up the former phyla Pogonophora and
                      Vestimentifera (the giant tube worms). The family is
                      composed of about 100 species of vermiform creatures which
                      live in thin tubes buried in sediments (Pogonophora) or in
                      tubes attached to hard substratum (Vestimentifera) at
                      ocean depths ranging from 100 to 10,000 m (300 to 32,800
                      ft). <br />They can also be found in association with
                      hydrothermal vents, methane seeps, sunken plant material,
                      and whale carcasses. The first specimen was dredged from
                      the waters of what is now Indonesia in 1900. These
                      specimens were given to French zoologist Maurice Caullery,
                      who studied them for nearly 50 years.
